Flipping the least significant bit of a given pixel intensity can only change the color of\n          that pixel by one hue, which is an imperceptibly change in color in a high frequency image with substantial\n          color variation. To decode the 1 image, the least significant bits of adjacent pixels are concatenated\n          together to represent the pixel intensities or RGB color values of the hidden images pixels.</p>\n        </Tab>\n        <Tab eventKey=\"team\" title=\"Team\">\n          <CardDeck>\n            <Card>\n              <Card.Img variant=\"top\" src=\"holder.js/100px160\" />\n              <Card.Body>\n                <Card.Title>Card title</Card.Title>\n                <Card.Text>\n                  This is a wider card with supporting text below as a natural lead-in to\n                  additional content.
