  <h4> Introduction </h4>
  <h5> Steganography is the practice of obfuscating data within another piece of data, of the same or different format, in order to prevent detection. The word steganography actually comes from Greek and means “hidden writing” (Johnson and Jajodia). While steganography can be used in any context that involves obfuscating data, the power of the principle can be easily illustrated using images because the minute changes to the original image used to encode another piece of data can be visually indistinguishable to the human eye. Images can be used to hide any data, including plain text files or other images. When the information is combined, it is called a stego-image. Steganography is not to be confused with cryptography, where information is scrambled and unusable without a known key; rather, steganography hides information without the intruder knowing where or how the information is hidden. The difference between the two is that cryptography requires an algorithm and a known key to decode, whereas steganography only requires the algorithm to decode a stego-image. This method in the form of ciphers has been used historically, for example when Mary Queen of Scots was trying to assassinate Queen Elizabeth of England to take her thrown (Anderson and Petitcolas). The principles of steganography can be combined with image processing to produce an effective scheme of obfuscating an image within another image.

The goal of our project is to create a steganography image encoder and decoder. Given two images, the encoder would obfuscate the data of one image within the binary data of another. Similarly, the decoder would take a single image as input and decode the binary data of that image to create a second, hidden image. Through these two processing steps, we have learned about bit manipulation in regards to images and how the distribution of pixel intensities within an image can be altered without making perceptible changes to the image’s appearance. Given time, we will also be attempting to make a streaming hidden image detector that will read in a stream of images and determine which, if any, contain obfuscated images. Some images may contain random binary data that can be successfully decoded into an image, and we will have to employ addition steps to determine whether this image contains a natural image or random noise. Lastly, we will make a user friendly interface for people to upload images to encode or decode.

<h4> Methods </h4>
  <h5> There are several steganographic algorithms that can be used to obfuscate an image within another image, and all of them take advantage of high frequency noise within an image that can be modified without an observable change. The algorithm we used is based on storing a low resolution image (the hidden image) inside a higher resolution image (the base image) by flipping the least significant bits of adjacent values in the base image to represent pixel intensities of the hidden image. This method is called Least Significant Bit Insertion (Johnson and Jajodia). Flipping the least significant bit of a given pixel intensity can only change the color of that pixel by one hue, which is an imperceptibly change in color in a high frequency image with substantial color variation. To decode the image, the least significant bits of adjacent pixels are concatenated together to represent the pixel intensities or RGB color values of the hidden image’s pixels. We extended our decoder to create a streaming hidden image detector, such that images will be decoded and automatically classified as containing a obfuscated natural image or not based on some process separating images of random noise from natural images by way of noise detection, edge detection, or some other process. We lastly created a React app in order to host our project and to allow users to encode and decode the images of their choosing.

  <h4> Results </h4>
    <h5> To date, we have completed some of the main points of our project. We have successfully implemented a least significant bit inserter in order to encode a hidden image within a base image of appropriate size. The base after encoding is visually indistinguishable from the base image beforehand, as can be seen in the image below. Note, however, that the histograms of the two images are slightly altered. This is because the encoding process can increase or decrease the intensity of a given pixel by one value.

<h5>We have also successfully implemented a decoder, which can extract an obfuscated hidden image from the least significant bits of a base image. Lastly, we have implemented a natural image detector, which predicts whether an image contains a natural image or random noise. We plan to connect this natural image detector to our decoder to create the streaming hidden image detector previously described.

One of the our biggest hurdles in this project has been efficiency. Originally our software took about 8 minutes to encode and decode an 8 Megapixel image. Users would be very likely to lose interest in our system given this prohibitive time constraint, and the inefficiency of our system would make a streaming hidden image detector unusable. We have employed several approaches to make our encoder and decoder more efficient. First, we refactored our encoder to algebraically determine the correct size of the hidden image to use before rescaling. To increase the efficiency of our decoder, we have vectorized the process of extracting the least significant bits, and we have employed a lookup table for computationally expensive values that are recomputed in multiple iterations. Given these changes, our software now takes about 1 minute to encode and decode an 8 Megapixel image. We plan to improve the performance of this system further if possible.

The last element we have been focusing on is the natural image detector. We have been working on multiple approaches, and testing them against a few examples. So far, it seems to be predicting our examples from class correctly as noise or natural image. We have tried three different approaches: connected component analysis, convolution edge detection, and canny edge detection. So far, the canny edge detection seems to be working the best because we can set the omega parameter to a point where it detects no edges in a noisy image but will detect some lines in a natural image. We are still currently working on our React app, and are still hoping to deploy it on basin.

<h4> Schedule </h4>

    <h5> Original plan:
The different components of the project are: the encoder, decoder, the streaming hidden image detector, and the UI. Our plan is to assign two weeks to complete the encoder/decoder, due by October 29. We will then create a test dataset to verify the accuracy of our devices by November 5. The project progress 3MT presentation will be held on October 30. We expect the implementation of the streaming hidden image detector to take about 20 days, thus it will be finalized by November 19. The UI and final touches are due on December 3, just ahead of our final project presentation on December 4. Any last modification to the code and UI will be implemented by the final project report date, December 12.

Outcome:
	We have more or less follow our defined schedule. The only component taking longer than expected is the React App. We have also pushed back the color encoder and decoder. We plan to finish both before our final project presentation.

  <h4> Issues </h4>
    <h5> We overcame several hurdles in implementing our encoder and decoder. Our first challenge was creating a steganographic encoding algorithm. We wrote our implementation independent of previous work on this topic. Therefore, we had to write our own bit encoding scheme and implement it in Python. Because every byte of the hidden image uses the least significant bits of eight bytes in the base image, our encoder has to scale the hidden image appropriately so that the base image contains at least eight times as many bytes as the hidden image. We also had to determine a method of encoding the dimensions of the original hidden image such that the decoder could extract and concatenate consecutive bytes and then reshape that data into an image of the correct size. To accomplish this, we used the least significant bits of the first 24 pixels of the base image to encode two twelve-bit values, indicating the length and width of the hidden image. These values allow one to encode images of dimension 4095x4095.

Debugging also proved challenging because the output of the encoder and the input to the decoder is obfuscated by nature. We had to manually print out consecutive bytes and compare the binary to debug. This process allowed us to discover that we were originally encoding the pixel intensities of our hidden image as big-endian integers and decoding them as little-endian integers. We also discovered that our hidden image was being decoded as signed integers rather than unsigned integers, which created issues with shifting bits. After overcoming these hurdles, our encoder and decoder work correctly.
</h5>


<h4> Future Work </h4>

  <h5> We are currently working on encoding and decoding color images. We would have liked to have tackled this problem earlier, but we decided instead to focus our energy on increasing the efficiency of our grayscale encoder and decoder and refactoring our node.js app. We also have not had time to assess the accuracy of our natural image detector on a dataset of encoded images. Since we have multiple implementations of the natural image detector, we will soon be testing each implementation on the same dataset. In addition, we want to test to see if there are some corner cases that the natural image detector implementations are not catching.

	A possible extension of this project could be to obfuscate any type of file within an image. This would be challenging to implement because it would require a deeper understanding of how file types are structured and how we could encode the type of file along with the data. Due to the complexity of this problem, and the fact that this is unrelated to image processing, we will not be attempting this application, though it is an interesting application of steganography.
