SSIM - structural similarity index matrix
we could use ssim as a detector of variation
		requires that we have access to the original image

brisk allows us to do quality analysis without having original reference image
	don't need to build SVM, use statistics of histogram to see if there is a real chang

to check decoded image for natural image
	use histogram, is it gaussian (natural) or uniform
	check connected components
